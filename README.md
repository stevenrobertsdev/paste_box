  ```
  
---
## Installation
Clone the repo or copy script.py to your local machine:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenrobertsdev/pastebox-cli.git
cd pastebox-cli
```
Install the required dependency:

 ```bash
pip install pyperclip
```
---

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal using Python:
```bash
python script.py [action]
```
Where [action] is one of the following:

### Paste new content
Prompts you to paste content directly into the terminal and then provide a title.

```bash
python script.py p
````
Paste multiple lines.

On Windows, press Ctrl + Z then Enter to finish pasting.

On Mac/Linux, press Ctrl + D.

You'll then be asked to enter a unique title. The content will be saved under this title.

### Copy content to clipboard
```bash
python script.py c
```
Prompts you to enter the title of the saved content.

If found, the associated content will be copied to your clipboard.

### List all stored content
```bash
python script.py l
```
Outputs a list of all saved entries, including their title, content, and date.

---

## Data Storage
All content is stored locally in a file named data.json in the same directory as the script.

Each entry includes:
```bash
{
  "title": "Example Title",
  "content": "Your saved text content...",
  "date": "2025-07-26"
}
```
## Notes
Titles must be unique â€” you'll be prompted to choose another if a duplicate is found.

If data.json does not exist, it will be created automatically the first time you add content.
